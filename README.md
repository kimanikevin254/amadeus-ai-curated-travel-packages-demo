# AI-Curated Travel Packages: A Node.js Demo for Dynamically Bundling Flights, Hotels & Activities with Amadeus

This demo app dynamically assembles personalized travel packages by combining data from Amadeus APIs for [flights](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/flights/api-doc/flight-offers-search/api-reference), [hotels](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/hotels/api-doc/hotel-search/api-reference), and [activities](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/destination-experiences/api-doc/tours-and-activities/api-reference). The [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/) then bundles and personalizes these results based on user preferences like travel style, budget, and activities, delivering coherent package recommendations.

## Features

-   Search flights, hotels, and activities for a destination.
-   Bundle results into a single, personalized travel package using OpenAI.
-   Frontend UI (Next.js) to gather preferences and display results.
-   Example itinerary, budget breakdown, and pro tips generated by AI.
